Human Stress Detection and Prediction Using ANN
Problem Statement
This project aims to build a system that detects human stress levels during sleep using physiological data. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to classify sleep data as "Stressed" or "Not Stressed."

Outcomes:
Physiological Data:
Recorded during sleep, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movements.
Labels:
Indicating stress levels (binary classification: 1 = Stressed, 0 = Not Stressed).
Predicted Stress Levels:
The model predicts stress levels during sleep.
Performance Metrics:
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated to assess model performance.
Visualizations:
Data distributions, training progress, and model performance are visualized for better understanding and analysis.
