# Human Stress Detection and Prediction Using ANN

## Problem Statement
This project aims to build a system that detects human stress levels during sleep using physiological data. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to classify sleep data as "Stressed" or "Not Stressed."

### Outcomes:
- **Physiological Data:** 
  - Recorded during sleep, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movements.
- **Labels:** 
  - Indicating stress levels (binary classification: 1 = Stressed, 0 = Not Stressed).
- **Predicted Stress Levels:** 
  - The model predicts stress levels during sleep.
- **Performance Metrics:** 
  - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated to assess model performance.
- **Visualizations:** 
  - Data distributions, training progress, and model performance are visualized for better understanding and analysis.
